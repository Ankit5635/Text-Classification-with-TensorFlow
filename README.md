# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Classification (3-Class LSTM Model)

This project builds and trains a **Bidirectional LSTM** model to classify IMDB movie reviews into **three sentiment classes**: **Negative**, **Neutral**, and **Positive**. The dataset is loaded from TensorFlow Datasets, and the model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Uses the IMDB Reviews dataset from TensorFlow Datasets.
- âœ… Converts binary sentiment labels (positive/negative) into 3 classes by randomly assigning a "Neutral" label to 30% of the training set.
- âœ… Preprocessing includes tokenization and padding.
- âœ… A Bidirectional LSTM model is trained to classify reviews.
- âœ… Evaluation includes accuracy, loss plots, and sample predictions.
